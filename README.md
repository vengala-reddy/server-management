## Importing & Using Components
To import and use components, follow these steps:
1. Declare the component in the `imports` array.
2. Use the component in your templates.

## Selectors
Selectors are used to define the custom HTML tags for your components. They can be defined using the `selector` property in the component decorator.

## Styling Components
Components can be styled using inline styles, external stylesheets, or Angular's built-in style encapsulation.

## Accepting Data with Input Properties
Input properties allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component using the `input` function.

## Custom Events with Outputs
Custom events can be created using the `@Output` decorator and `EventEmitter` to allow child components to send data to parent components.

## Function-Based Outputs
Function-based outputs enable you to handle events and data emission using functions.

## Content Projection with `ng-content`
Content projection allows you to insert content into a component from outside the component using the `ng-content` directive.

## Component Host Elements
Component host elements can be styled and manipulated using the `:host` selector in the component's styles.

## Component Lifecycle
Angular components have a lifecycle managed by Angular. Key lifecycle hooks include `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngOnDestroy`, etc.

## Referencing Component Children with Queries
You can reference child components and DOM elements using `viewChild()` and `contentChild()` decorators.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to working with Angular components, covering essential concepts and best practices.
